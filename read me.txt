Project: Comprehensive Network Design Using Cisco Packet Tracer
Role: Network EngineerTechnologies Used: Cisco Packet Tracer, VLANs, Static Routing, NAT, ACLs, DHCP, DNS, Syslog, Trunking, ROSDescription:Designed and implemented a multi-VLAN network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer, featuring a central router connected to multiple switches and end devices. Configured VLANs for segmenting network traffic, implemented static routing for efficient packet forwarding, and enabled NAT to facilitate internet connectivity. Secured the network with Access Control Lists (ACLs) and set up an enable password for device access control. Deployed DHCP for dynamic IP address allocation and DNS for name resolution, while integrating Syslog for logging and monitoring. Utilized trunking to interconnect switches and ensured robust connectivity. Additional configurations included backup configurations for redundancy. Tested the network using ping, traceroute, and verified configurations to ensure optimal performance and security.
